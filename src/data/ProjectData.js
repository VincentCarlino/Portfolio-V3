Seeing as this is my first full-time position as a developer, I\’ve solidified my passion for programming.  Before joining Catalant, I knew little about the stack, so the first few months of my employment required me to acquire new skills quickly.  While the learning curve was steep, I am now incredibly comfortable with agile development cycles, version control, and debugging code when necessary.  Working as a developer full time certainly encouraged growth as a developer as I became increasingly independent, efficient, and persistent in executing my projects.'}],
